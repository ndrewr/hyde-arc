## ***Why code?***

I graduated from a CS program dreading software development.

Degree in hand, I felt adrift between process and end-user. I did other things like teaching and business school. *Meanwhile the web evolved.* It grew faster and faster, leapt to other screens, *served more and more people*.


## ***To Create and Contribute.***

This potential to serve cemented in my mind while taking my first online course.

The course, naturally:  [Web Development](https://www.udacity.com/course/web-development--cs253).

The web sends barriers crumbling. It...

Delivers endless resources.

Facilitates collaboration.

Eases the friction in distribution.

Like puzzle pieces falling into place, *I found myself charting a path.*


## ***As a web engineer.***

I am the type that exalts good layout, who compulsively [wappalyzes](https://wappalyzer.com/) web pages. I'll spend hours for a moment of code clarity, trade days to save precious seconds of User load time.

I'm comfortable in a multitude of environments. I work well by myself but I thrive with good people. Whether for a client, with a parter or in a team my goal remains to do great works.

Like a record of my developer journey, here are some of the things I have been building on [GitHub]({{site.github.main}}).

A copy of my resume is [right here]({{site.linkedin}}).

You can also find me on [LinkedIn]({{site.linkedin}}).


## Setup

Some fun facts about the setup of this project include:

* Built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
* Hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* Inspired by the development experiences shared by [Development Seed](https://developmentseed.org/blog/2011/09/09/jekyll-github-pages/) and [on the blog](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/) of Joshua Lande.
