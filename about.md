<p class="message">
   Having a canvas on which to create. A medium to deliver what I make to anyone. The leverage to contribute beyond arm's reach. I love working on the front-end of web development.
</p>

Admittedly, it took me years to figure out why I wanted to invest my energies shaping software. I went many places and have done many things in the interim. I finally reached the intersection described above and have been furiously revving down this path ever since.

I am the kind of engineer who stops to admire a clever layout; who will compulsively [wappalyze](https://wappalyzer.com/) a web page he has never visited. I am the type who is willing to give hours for that moment he strikes on the perfect font; who will trade days to save milliseconds of User load time.

I work well by myself, in solemn or raucous environments. I thrive with good people, and love to see quality ingredients coalesce into a magical whole. Whether for a client, with a parter or among a team I burn to do great works.

Please feel free to check out some of the things I have been building on [GitHub]({{ site.github.main }}).
