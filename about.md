*Why make software?*

CS degree in hand, I could not yet answer that question. Instead I went off to many places to do many other things. Years later I came upon the intersection.

   To Create and Contribute.

The web provided collaboration and endless resources. It took friction out of distribution. Barriers were erased and I felt invigorated.

**I still do!**

I have become the kind of engineer who pauses to parse layout; who compulsively [wappalyzes](https://wappalyzer.com/) web pages. I'll fork over hours for a moment of code clarity; trade days to save precious seconds of User load time.

I work well by myself but I thrive with good people, whether in solemn or raucous environments. Whether for a client, with a parter or among a team I am burning to do great works.

Please feel free to check out some of the things I have been building on [GitHub]({{ site.github.main }}).

A copy of my resume is [right here]({{ site.linkedin }}).
I am on [LinkedIn]({{ site.linkedin }}), too.
